 note = {The main goal of Nox is to give control mechanisms a global view of the network. It introduces a new networking paradigm based on simple switches enslaved to a logically centralized decision. Compared to previous related works Nox brings the ability to scale this centralized paradigm to very large systems and allows general programmatic control of the network.},
